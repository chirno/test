First off we need to install node.js so if you haven't done that then you will need to do that.

Information about setting up gulp can be found at the following website.

I then set up browser-sync for us as a development dependency.
Info on browser-sync can be found at the following website.

In cmd you can try using gulp in this directory and it should launch a server that displays our index.html file by default. Try it out :P
